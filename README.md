BukkitBoard [UNSTABLE]
===========

A console-based Bulletin Board Plugin for Bukkit Minecraft Servers


##Letter From the Developer 
=======
Currently this build is unstable and is nowhere near where we'd like it to be. Don't worry, once i get a stable version working(Shortly), i'll be making a more efficient unstable branch... (Still was getting used to Source Control and git at the start of the project)
