##Letter From the Developer

Spiro (Speewave) here - I moved this out from my own user to an organization

so instead of Speewave/Bukkitboard it's /BukkitBoard/Bukkitboard (A tad redundant, but whatever) Feel free to contribute!
[Speewave/bukkitboard is just my development work, a fork of this repo]

##Dependencies
As of the latest Commit... you'll need:

* Latest CraftBukkit Development API

##Commands
- /bbp [board] [message] - Post message to a board!
