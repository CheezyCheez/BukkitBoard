BukkitBoard
===========

A console-based Bulletin Board Plugin for Bukkit Minecraft Servers, Not yet ready for stable release

##Notes
=======
* This is my first Java project \ Bukkit Plugin \ Git Repo... so expect things to be messy, and unlike the norm
* I come from a C#\C++ background... so my brackets may end up on another line <gasp>. feel free to bring it up to code if it is a concern
* This Project can be fully imported using EGit + Eclipse.. however, it saves the project showing that the Bukkit API is on my desktop, you'll need to fix that before compiling... 
* ^ I may just put only source up so for the sanity of others... maybe in a future commit when i git (heh puns) the hang of things

##Dependencies
===========
As of the latest Commit... you'll need:

* Latest CraftBukkit Development API


##Commands
===========
... Well We're not there yet!
